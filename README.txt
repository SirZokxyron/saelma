SÆLMA is a custom shell written for our System course.
All of the code has been done by hand since we thought 
it'd be a better  exercise to build the  whole project
from  the ground up.  Along  all that,  we added  some 
custom  functions  to  spice  up  the  user  interface.

We hope you will like the experience it provides.
